The folder "xvg files" contains the .xvg files with the calculated Lennart-Jones and Coulomb interactions between the chemicals and the H+ ions.

Run first the script "figures.py" to generate the medians, percentiles and standard deviations. 
Run then "Summary2.py" to summarize the data into one .csv file.

Finally, run "multireg.py" to develop the model.
