# Welcome to ElectroChem!

## ElectroChem is a computational workflow for predicting the ionization efficiency of chemicals in electrospray ionization using principles of computational chemistry. As opposed to machine learning approaches, ElectroChem is a theory-based approach and does not require large datasets to train and test.
