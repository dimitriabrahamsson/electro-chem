## Welcome to ElectroChem!

### ElectroChem is a computational workflow for predicting the ionization efficiency of chemicals in electrospray ionization using principles of computational chemistry. 

#### As opposed to machine learning approaches, ElectroChem is a theory-based approach and does not require large datasets to train and test.
