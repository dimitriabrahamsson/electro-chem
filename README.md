## Welcome to ElectroChem!

### ElectroChem is a computational workflow for predicting the ionization efficiency of chemicals in electrospray ionization using principles of computational chemistry. 

#### As opposed to machine learning approaches, ElectroChem is a theory-based approach and does not require large datasets to train and test. 

ElectroChem is part of a project that is currently under review. 

The 'OH box' folder contains the parameter and topology files for generating a cube containing OH- ions. The box was later used to dissolve each chemical used in the calculations. The sytem was neutralized by the addition of H+ ions. 

The 'mdp files' folder contains the files that were used for the simulations with GROMACS.
